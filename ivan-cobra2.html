            <p>(I am not going to go over everything because that would be really boring and long so we will just skip about 5 years ahead because five years is a good amount of time). Ivan was all trained to go out in the wild, but Ivan did not want to leave. So Ivan stayed. The wife was reading the newspaper when she saw an article about the “Cobra Fight League” (C.F.L.) and she could tell Ivan wanted to enroll, so she enrolled him, and started training him right away. Ivan was working on slithering faster, biting harder, whipping his tail faster and harder, and he worked on his dodging and attacking skills</p>
            <p>Ivan trained day and night for his first season in the C.F.L. Three months later came Ivan's first matchup, it was against “Axel the King” (rank 11 last year, currently rank 13), Ivan knew this was going to be a tough match. Ivan started to get warmed up, then he got into the ring and saw his opponent in the other corner, he heard the bell ring Ivan slithered over to Axel to start off with the first hit, but Axel started off with a mighty tail whip, but Ivan wasn't going to let that happen so he whipped him back with an even stronger  tail whip,  tail whip after  tail whip by Ivan, and he finishes off with a strangle, 1…2…3 knockout and Ivan had won, and was now filled with the joy of his first victory. This went on for all of the season's 14 games, and Ivan was undefeated going into the tournament. And guess what? The same exact thing happened throughout the tournament, and he was now champion. He was up against “Slitherio the  Other Champion” (Slitherio won the last 9 years in a row, undefeated 10 years in a row Rank 97 last year, rank 132 this year). Slitherio was said to be the best cobra fighter throughout the 31 years of the cobra fight club. Ivan had trained so hard and for so long for this moment, he can't give up now.</p>
