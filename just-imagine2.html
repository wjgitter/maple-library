            Chapter 2: Bus Kid
        </div>
            <p>Beep. Beep. Beep. I am startled awake from my restless sleep by the sound of my alarm clock. I turn over and slam it until the beeping stops. I sit up in my bed and stretch, yawning. I put on my slippers and walk downstairs to find my mom already in the kitchen making me breakfast. I sit at the table and watch her while she finishes up the eggs and bacon.</p>
            <p>“Here you go sweetly, eat fast though we mustn't be late to your first day.” She says with a smile as she sets the plate of food in front of me.</p>
            <p>“I know!” I exclaim a bit annoyed with a mouth full of food. My mom never stops worrying about getting places on time. I love her for it though.</p>
            <p>Once I finish my breakfast I head upstairs to get dressed. I decided on some evergreen cargo pants and one of my favorite oversized t-shirts. I throw my hair into a quick braid and brush my teeth. Then I grab my backpack from its hanger and fill it with my notebooks, pencil case, Chrome book, and a reading book. I head downstairs to see if my mom is ready to take me.</p>
            <p>“There you are! I almost thought you were going to miss the bus.” She exclaimed as I emerged from the alcove that the stairs we located in. </p>
            <p>“Wait what? I am taking the bus? I have never taken the bus before, you always take me,” I replied confused.</p>
            <p>“Oh, did I forget to tell you? You will be taking the bus this year because my job has asked me to start coming in a bit earlier so I can leave a little earlier to get him before dinner. You will also be taking it home until I can find a carpool.” She answered.</p>
            <p>I sigh. How many things can change in one month? I put on my converse and head outside to wait for the bus. After only a few minutes it pulls up and the doors open. I can already smell the spoiled milk and throw up. When I get on I am horrified to see that it is almost fully packed with kids ranging from third grade all the way to eighth grade. I walk down the aisle looking for anywhere to sit. Finally towards the middle of the bus I find an open seat with no one in it yet.</p>
            <p>As soon as I sit down the bus lurches forwards and starts heading towards school. I set my backpack next to me and stare out the window at the passing city. After only a couple more stops we arrive at the school.</p>
            <p>“Everybody off!” The bus driver yelled over the screaming chaos that was behind him.</p>
            <p>I leave the bus, getting pushed and shoved as I do so. After what felt like years I was outside the school smelling the fresh air that did not have the smell of sweaty kids filling it up. The school was huge. The walls were made of brick and lined with windows. I walked along the sidewalk, following the other kids. Until I finally found the very modern looking entrance. I entered through the glass doors and looked around. The floors were big square tiles and all the walls were covered in murals and trophy cases.</p>
            <p>I kept walking until I found the door labeled Office. I knocked and heard a voice respond to my knock with, “Come in!”</p>
            <p>“Hello.” I said quietly and respectfully as I entered the room. It had a carpet floor and was filled with filing cabinets. In the center sat behind a huge wooden desk sat who I presumed to be the principal.</p>
            <p>“We have no need to be shy, we are all very happy for you to be joining us. Here is your schedule and a map of the school. I hope you find your first class on time.” She said as she handed me the papers and ushered me out of the room.</p>
            <p>As soon as I was out of the room the door closed behind me and I was left alone. Only a few kids still wandered through the hallways. I glanced at my schedule, my first class was English with Mr. Weiben. It was located in room 302 in the right wing of the school. I flipped over the paper to look at the map. If I was reading it right it was only a few turns away from where I was standing right now.</p>
            <p>I walked with my head down looking at the map, making sure I didn't make a wrong turn anywhere. Suddenly I feel something rush past me. I look up. No one is around me. I glanced behind me. Still nothing. I shrug it off and keep walking. Soon I am in front of room 302. I put my hand on the shiny, round metal handle and turned it, pushing forward through the door and into the classroom. Every head turns my way and I can feel my cheeks turn into bright red tomatoes.</p>
