        </div>
            <p>The great story of Ivan the cobra started this exact day twelve years ago.</p>
            <p>There was a random egg in the middle of a garden, and a short, plump man just got done shaving his bushes, and he was going to mow his lawn when he saw a decent sized egg with no animal or anything around it. The short, plump man went to go check it out. He could not tell what kind of egg it was, so he brought it inside and showed his wife to see if she could tell what kind of egg it was. She couldn't tell either.</p>
            <p>They went and put it by the fireplace and took care of it and watched it for a while, and the short, plump man said “I need to go mow the lawn, could you watch the egg?” The wife said yes, and the short, plump man went to mow his lawn. The farmer later got done mowing his lawn and came back inside, and right then the egg started to hatch, and the short plump man came over to see the egg hatch. The egg hatched and they saw a small snake slowly slither out of the shell. They saw the snake and didn't know what to do. So they grabbed the snake and gently put it inside a big box as if it were made of glass.</p>
            <p>The short, plump man started talking to his wife about what they should do with the snake. The wife said they could raise it. “We don't have enough time,” said the short, plump man. Then the wife said she could raise it and the short, plump, slightly annoyed man said “okay” your choice. So the wife started raising the snake. She checked out a book from the library on how to raise different types of snakes. </p>
            <p>She went to the page that looked most like the snake she had and read the title of the page “How to Raise a Cobra.” She was shocked by what she saw, she could not believe she had to raise a cobra. She got home and started reading the book. She finished reading a couple days later. She named the cobra Ivan, and did everything the book said.</p>
