            <p>THE NEXT DAY</p>
            <p>Ben and his neighbors had a hard time sleeping because the fried chicken kept banging on the window and then fell asleep outside the window and the other neighbors where confused because there was a big fried chicken outside of the window and the neighbors started to eat the fried chicken and ate it all and then the fried chicken grew back and  chased the family but they came to safety in their house with THREE METAL DOORS (For some reason everyone in the neighborhood has THREE METAL DOORS!) So the chicken starts having babies and they all grow 5 feet tall and then they start running around and then all of them ran away in the city and start going all around the world and going on fried chicken airplanes around the world and...</p>
            <p>THE NEXT DAY</p>
            <p>Ben wakes up and gets ready to go outside and beat that chicken up! And he gets ready, gets a torch and a bat and a fork cause he would kill them and then cook them with a torch and then eat them and then go and fight again he did that for the whole day. The next day he went out and got an ATV from the machine dealership. He got the ATV and then he saw a Fried Chicken cornering someone so he drove over and took his torch and put it right on the fried chicken and then the fried chicken got engulfed in the flames and boom the girl who he helped was his girlfriend that he was going to propose to the day that this all started so they hugged and she thanked him.</p>
