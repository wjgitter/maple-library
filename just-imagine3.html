            Chapter 3: The Note
        </div>
            <p>“You must be the new student!” exclaimed Mr. Weiben, “Go ahead and sit over there by the window and take out your notebook. We have just begun our new book so you don't have to worry too much about catching up with the rest of the class.</p>
            <p>I walk over to where he is pointing and slide into my seat. The chair is cold and I shiver as I touch it. I hang my backpack on the hook jutting out from the desk and pull out my notebook and pencil case. I take notes on the annotation process as Mr. Weiben goes over them. Soon the class is over and time to head on to the next one which I am not looking forward to because it is mathematics.</p>
            <p>“Don't forget this!” Mr. Weiben says as he hands me a book while I am leaving the class.</p>
            <p>“Thanks.” I mutter as I continue on my way to find the math room. It was only a few hallways down but it still took me a while to find, especially with the swarm of kids going every which way. When I entered I quickly found the only open seat, located towards the back, before the teacher could enter and make a scene about me again in front of everybody.</p>
            <p>Not much happened and I kind of zoned out during the class discussion over the fraction problems we were working with. The teacher gave me a massive text book that she assigned homework in and then class was over. The next period, social studies, flew by in a blink of an eye because it was just a simple lecture that normally would bore me but since I was out of his line of sight I just got to doodle the entire time. </p>
            <p>The next period was lunch, something I had been dreading all day. I looked around the lunchroom, trying to find any open seats, or ideally, an open table with nobody else. Sadly I saw none. But I did see a table that was pretty empty and went over and sat down. The few kids that were there only glanced at me then went back to what they were doing.</p>
            <p>I took my lunch box out of my bag and began to eat the wrap that I had packed the previous night. I continued to eat my food until all my chips and raspberries were finished as well. All too soon the bell rang and it was time for the afternoon classes to begin. I ran all the way to the end of the left wing for gym class where they were halfway through their pickleball unit. I hate moving school in the third trimester I think as I change out of my sweaty gym clothes back into my normal ones. </p>
            <p>My last class of the day was science. When I walked in the teacher greeted me and then partnered me with a kid named Alex. He was okay, but kept messing up the experiment. When the final bell rang I sprinted back to the doors I had come through at the beginning of the day. I followed the sidewalk back to the bus stop and while I was staring at my shoes waiting for the bus I felt the same cold wind blow past me again. I look up, no one and the trees are still. There was no wind today. Weird I think, a bit shaken from the event.</p>
            <p>Soon the bus arrived and I was able to get on and head home. The ride was even bumpier and more chaotic than the one from that morning. Luckily my stop was one of the first ones. When I arrived at my house I reached into my back pocket to grab the house key my mom had given me earlier that morning but felt nothing. Panicked, I set my backpack on the ground and began to rummage through it. With a sigh of relief I found it in the time pocket at the top. </p>
            <p>I was a bit weirded out because I don't remember putting it there but shrugged it off as I headed inside. I grabbed sparkling water and a tray of cucumbers and dip as I headed up to my room to work on my homework assignment. I set my backpack on the floor next to my desk and fell into my seat. Today was such a headache of the day. I pull out my math notebook and assignment and begin to work on the problems we were assigned. Suddenly, as I flip to a new page in my notebook, I see five words on it. I want to talk to you.</p>
