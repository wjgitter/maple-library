            <p>Ivan just got done doing his warm up routine, and stepped into the ring and saw Slitherio for the first time. “The bell rings, and this time Slitherio slithered up to Ivan and goes for the first hit with a tail whip, but he misses and Ivan goes for a tail whip, and also misses,” comments the commentator, “You know Tim you don't normally see this from Ivan or Slitherio, I mean they are both great fighters and always land their hits no matter what.” “I agree with you Fred, but I think they are both just so good at dodging they are impossible to hit, alright back to the fight,” Fred proclaims, “OOOOO Slitherio lands the first hit with a very mighty tail whip and Ivan is very hurt. Ivan goes up for a move, misses, and falls to the ground, 1…2… Ivan moves his tail and avoids the knockout. Ivan gets back up and strikes Slitherio with a superior tail whip, over and over and over again,” the commentators says, “Wow Fred that was amazing you never see that.” “Yeah Tim I mean, like seven straight perfect tail whips have only ever happened once. Now eight…” replies Fred,“Ivan might have a shot at this.” Ivan goes for the strangle and gets it! Tighter and tighter he goes, Ivan releases 1…2…3 Ivan is the champion everybody in the stands goes nuts, except for one mongoose by the name of The Macho Nacho. </p>
            <p><p></p></p>
            <p>The Macho Nacho runs into the ring and says “Ahh you! I recognize you, you have a scar under your neck just like your mother. I should have destroyed your egg while I could.” “Fine let's do this,” said Ivan, Slitherio slithers off of the ring, and The Macho Nacho v.s. Ivan was about to go down, they were both ready, the bell rang! The Macho Nacho runs up to Ivan and Ivan goes for the strangle and gets it Ivan strangles very very hard, everybody is cheering for Ivan, then Ivan releases the strangle 1…2…3 knockout. Ivan is victorious once again. </p>
            <p><p></p></p>
            <p>Later that day Ivan went home and celebrated. Ivan's family was so proud. Ivan later won 10 more straight championships and was crowned the best cobra fighter in history.</p>
