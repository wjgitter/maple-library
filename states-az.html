            Arizona
        </div>
            <p>Arizona is a very dry place, and I'm frankly surprised how so many people have survived the heat for so long without 300 spf. Arizona has a very strong job market and cultural richness. Arizona has many trade lines that would probably make it hard for another state to take them down since they have lots of already built alliances with states all over the country. The main alliances are Texas and New Mexico, which are both pretty powerful states. They have a decent chance of having a semi-strong military, so that might work to their advantage. But in the long run, they'll probably be eaten by coyotes. Not the coyotes!</p>
            <p><p></p></p>
            <p>“Hey, coyotes, we can talk about this. We only ate some of your pack because we were starving to death, you helped us! Please please please, don't eat us! And please please please let us live long enough to survive through this war.” Not Arizona being Sabrina Carpenter. </p>
            <p>“I'm working late, cause I'm a coyote.” Sabrina shtoppp ittttttt.</p>
            <p>“Y tho? Rly, y should i?” Sabrina asked.</p>
            <p>“Just, please please please. There I did it, are u happy Sabrina?” </p>
            <p>“Yes, I can die happy” Sabrina goes bye bye. As Sabrina carpenter ascended she made one wish to kill the coyotes so now they're all dead. Yippity skippity doo dah Arizona lives! Is that really a positive in this war though? Come on, think about it. Arizona is bad bad danger. We got bad blood with Arizona. Taylor is here nowwwww erm I think Taylor is dead. Yeah sorry the old Taylor can't come to the phone rn. why? cuz she's dead.</p>
