            <p>It all started when 15 year old Ella got a babysitting job. She took up the offer and now it was Friday night and she headed over to her babysitting job. The parents told her she could let their kid James have ice cream after dinner if he finished his meal. When the parents left, and James finished his meal, he asked Ella if he could have some ice cream. </p>
            <p>Ella remembered what the parents said, “Sure, I'll go get it.” “where do you keep it?” </p>
            <p>“In the basement so it keeps cold,” The little boy James replied. </p>
            <p>She headed down into the basement. It was chilly but not freezing. She opened the freezer and pulled out vanilla ice cream. In that same moment she realized she wasn't alone. Up in the basement window a grandma appeared to be watching her. A faint smile spread across her face. She rushed upstairs with the ice cream. Thinking it was all just a dream she didn't say anything. </p>
            <p>But James did. “ I want sprinkles too. Can you go get some?” So she headed back into the basement. She quickly grabbed the sprinkles. Out of curiosity she looked up to the basement window. The grandma was still there but this time her smile was a bit bigger. She rushed back upstairs. </p>
            <p>She was going to ask James if there was a grandma in the neighborhood, but before she could ask he said, “Can you please get whipped cream too? Pretty Please?” So she headed back into the basement. After she grabbed whipped cream, she couldn't help but look up to the basement. The grandma was still there. Her smile was physically impossible. It was so big. She nearly killed herself running upstairs. </p>
            <p>About to call the parents, James interrupted her again, “Can I have cherries too?” Ella should have stayed upstairs. But she went back into the basement. She grabbed the cherries and rushed upstairs. She looked behind her and the grandma was no longer in the window. So she thought all was well. But what happened next was so bad she never though that night.</p>
            <p>She found James' dead body on the floor and his head in the arms of the grandma. A knife clutched in her pale hands. </p>
            <p>She dashed outside and called the parents, “You need to come home right now! I got ice cream for James since he was done with his meal so I kept getting him stuff for his ice cream and was a grandma in the window and she kept smiling at me. I thought It was nothing though SHE KILLED JAMES!!!!! Please hurry home!!”</p>
            <p>“Wait,” The parents said, “Did you say there was a grandma in the window? That's odd because we don't have any windows in are basement.”</p>
