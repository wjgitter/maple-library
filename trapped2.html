            Chapter 2
        </div>
            <p>Pierre was knocked out half of the time, but when he woke up he tried communicating with the driver. Pierre made sure to be cordial about it though. </p>
            <p>“Sir! Sir! I would be most gracious if you would release me!”</p>
            <p>Pierre said, there was no answer. Then Pierre tried to vilify the driver. Again there was no answer. Suddenly, the door opened. Pierre had been driven to his friend George's house for George's birthday party and the kidnapper was his own father.</p>
            <p>So many thoughts were rushing through Pierre's head. His own father, a kidnapper? All that Pierre could muster out was,</p>
            <p>“Why?”.</p>
            <p>Pierre's father responded sincerely with,</p>
            <p>“I was going to drive you here but then you snuck out.”</p>
            <p>It all made sense, Pierre's father wasn't a master criminal, he was just a loving father. A small crowd had gathered around the conspicuous  white van unloading Pierre. Pierre gave everyone a brief explanation, saying,</p>
            <p>“It was just a prank.”</p>
            <p>It was unanimous that everyone thought that was an acceptable answer. After that, everyone had an amazing time at George's party. So, Pierre went home unkidnapped and on good terms with his father.</p>
