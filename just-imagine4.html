            Chapter 4: Unknown Text
        </div>
            <p>I feel my heart pound against my chest as I read and reread the message. I slam the notebook shut and fling it across the room. The pages split open as it hits the ground and bend every which way. I am terrified but have to get the rest of my homework done so I pull out my chromebook and type out the observations from the experiment we did in science. Then I checked my email, trying to pass time.</p>
            <p>Finally I had nothing left to do but to finish my math homework. I walked over to the notebook and flipped it over. Nothing. I leaf through all the pages. The message is gone. Now I am getting a bit weirded out. I sit back at my desk and finish my math homework. I am putting my things away when my phone rings. I go over and pick it up off my night stand and look at the screen. Unknown number. </p>
        <div class="computer">
            <br/>
            <p>Hello? I text. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>Hey, it texts back. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>Who are you?</p>
            <br/>
            <p>My name is Luke. I need your help.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>I don't know you, you must have the wrong number.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>I don't. I know your name is Maddie and I really need your help.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>I will help you as long as you leave me alone afterwards.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Deal. Tomorrow is Saturday. No school. Meet me at Roseberry Park at 1:30.</p>
            <br/>
        </div>
            <p><p></p></p>
            <p>What the heck I think as I set the phone down. There is no way I am actually going. That would be stupid. I will tell my mom about it when she gets back from work. That is the smart thing to do. I need to be smart and make the right decisions. My mom is trusting me to be responsible when I am home alone without her. </p>
            <p>These thoughts are swirling around my head and distracting me. So the time ends up getting away from me and as I am pacing the living room my mom arrives home. I turn to look and open my mouth to  say something about the mysterious texts when I take a look at her and shut up. Her hair is disheveled and her eye bags somehow got darker than they were this morning. I don't want to worry her more. I'll just keep quiet for now I think.</p>
            <p>“Hey sweety. How was your first day? I know starting on a Friday is a bit weird but I wanted you to start as soon as possible.” She says.</p>
            <p>“It was good. Do you want me to order pizza for dinner? You look like you really need a break.” I respond with a bit of a shake to my voice.</p>
            <p>“That would be great sweety, but only order yourself one I am going to be eating later tonight because I have a lot of important emails to attend to.” She responded to me appreciatively.</p>
            <p>I order the pizza and wait for it in the living room. While I wait I begin to scroll through tik tok on my phone. No new trends today surprisingly. Just some random food and dress stuff that they recommended for me to watch. Soon the pizza arrives and I go and grab it from the delivery person. As I am sitting down and eating I look up at the chandelier hanging above the dining table and see rainbow lighting coming from it. The pizza drops from my hand and my mouth falls open. As I stare more I see animals inside the lighting, the only problem is that I see unicorns and dragons. Things that shouldn't exist.</p>
            <p>I blink repeatedly until suddenly it disappears. What is going on today? The rainbow lightning took away my appetite and I set the rest of the leftover pizza into the fridge for later. I then grab my phone and go upstairs. As I am nearing my door I hear high pitched voices inside. They are talking about some sort of magic veil. I barge in ready to see a bunch of people but instead am greeted with nothing but an empty room. My breathing goes heavy. Am I delusional? Have I been too stressed and too upset with everything that has been happening in my life recently? </p>
            <p>Maybe I just need to rest. I go over to my closet and pull out some comfortable clothing and change into it. I grab one of my favorite books off the shelf and begin to read it. Soon the sun sets and I set my book on my night stand. Get under the covers and go to sleep. I dream about weird rainbow lightning and guys named Luke. By the time I wake up it is already 9:00. I groan as I get out of bed. My back is sore from leaning over desks all day yesterday and my hand cramps from all the writing. </p>
