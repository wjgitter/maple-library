            <p>Before I start, I want to thank my friend who told me this story. Of course, I added my own bits here and there.</p>

            <p>And yet again I have to add a warning so if you don't already know this is a scary story. Now you do.</p>

            <p>A mother was in her kitchen cooking dinner for her two toddlers. It was a nice warm spring day so she made hot dogs. Her husband's favorite. She didn't expect anything bad to happen. Until she got a phone call. She picked up the phone. </p>

            <p>“I'm covered in red roses and I'm in your country.” </p>

            <p>She put the phone down, probably just a spam call. </p>

            <p>About 20 minutes later she got another phone call. </p>

            <p>“I'm covered in red roses and I'm in your state.” </p>

            <p>She put the phone down again but with more caution.</p>


            <p>Another 20 minutes went by and she was almost done with the hot dogs. Before she could finish she got another phone call. </p>

            <p>“I'm covered in red roses and I'm in your city.”</p>

            <p>She dropped the phone and went to check on the kids.</p>

            <p>They were fine but she wasn't. She was worried out of her mind. She calmed herself down and set the table. Just then she got another phone call. Before she could answer it, it answered itself. </p>

            <p>“I'm covered in red roses and I'm in your neighborhood.”</p>

            <p>She ran to check on the kids.</p>

            <p>Still playing peacefully. So she continued on. The phone spoke again. </p>

            <p>“I'm covered in red roses and I'm in your house.” </p>

            <p>She screamed! </p>
            <p>She ran to the kids. They were gone. Before she could call 911 she got another call. </p>

            <p>“I'm covered in red roses and I'm right behind you.”</p>

            <p>She wasn't seen again.</p>

            <p>Her neighbors came to look for her but the only thing they found was a trial of red roses leading to her dead body.</p>
