                Chapter 1: New Beginning
        </div>
            <p>
                I push my hair out of my face as the moving truck drives away.
                I don't want to turn around and look at my new house. What if I don't like it? 
                What if it is completely different from the old one?    
            </p>
            <p>
                “Sweety please help me move the boxes inside, they can't sit out here long.
                We have a rainstorm coming.”
                My mom shouts at me. I look to the sky,
                huge elephant-like gray clouds are coming in from the east.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Coming!” I shout back.
                Finally I turn around and look at the house.
                It is pretty ginormous looking
                . The siding is a gray blue color that matches the sky,
                and the roof is composed of different shades of black shingles.
                As the wind howls through, the windows shudder but stay together. 
                Light tan brick walls lay In a certain places creating great accent points to the house.
                I like it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I swing my bag on to my shoulder, grab one of the boxes labeled Maddie's room and head in.
                The inside looks even better than the outside.
                Big windows line the walls, that let in lots of natural lights,
                and are draped with beautiful flowing curtains. 
                All the furniture was moved in previously and it gave the house a cozy feel. 
                Most of it was new since my dad wanted to keep all the other furniture back at the old house. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I head to the stairs made of a beautifully stained wood of the colors you
                would normally only see in movies.
                I go up step by step taking in the new house.
                I go all the way up to the top, passing the second floor and heading to the third.
                It is much smaller up here, only room for one room, my room.
                There is a door for privacy but otherwise it is completely open inside.
                My canopy bed is set against the far wall,
                and the wall opposite was lined with bookshelves,
                empty, waiting for me to fill them.
            </p>
            <p>
                I set my bag and box on the bed and flop down next to them.
                I think about all the things that have happened in the past couple of weeks.
                My parents divorce,  moved, and I changed schools.
                It was all so unexpected and confusing,
                and I am still working on processing.
                But for now all I should worry about is moving into the new house.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, all the boxes have been put in their corresponding rooms,
                and we can start unpacking them.
                I like to organize my boxes by how long they will take me.
                My books and bedding will take the longest.
                My plants and reading corner come next.
                Then my hanging chair. And finally my carpets.
            </p>
            <p>
                My room was begging to come together and I was really liking it.
                The white curtains I had bought looked great against the windows,
                they were so flown and partially see through.
                My book shelf wall was filled with all my favorite reads and lots of my treasured trinkets.
                I had filled a corner with pillows, blankets, and two bean bags for a reading nook and set
                up my desk on the other wall for writing and drawing.
                My green and carpet fit the room perfectly and matched the lush plants I scattered around.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sun glared through the window onto my face as I admired my work.
                I reached into my pocket and checked the screen. One notification and three missed calls.
                Confused, I tapped into it and realized my dad had been trying to contact me.
                A bit concerned, I called him.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Hey sweetheart, how is the move going?” He asked me when he answered after only three rings.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Good, I just finished my room and I think mom has finished downstairs.”
                I replied happily. “Did you need anything else? I noticed you were trying to talk to me earlier.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “No, I just wanted to check in, I know this has been hard for you.” He said apologetically.
            </p>
            <p>
                “It's fine!” I say cheerily back, “but I got to go help mom with the bathroom so i'll have to talk more later.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sounds good, have a good night in the new home.”
                 He says as I hit the end call button on my phone.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Soon the sun is setting and it is time for the first night in the new home.
                 I don't know how to feel about today so I pull on my favorite pair of pajamas and brush my teeth.
                  I know this is the right decision for mom and dad since things back home were not working out but it was still a hard blow when they broke the news to me that they were getting a divorce.
                 I remember spending the whole night in my room, crying until I had no tears left.
            </p>
