            <p>The army that will take down the fried chicken world headquarters is all trained up and ready to kick some chicken butt! The fried chicken world headquarters is getting stronger and is getting  more soldiers because the bases got new fried chicken deep fryers. They are now mass producing and are already training them and are getting ready to attack! So we fly in, drive, drive in tanks, and march by foot, and even ride boats. </p>

            <p>We all get ready and start attacking all the soldiers in front. We hit them at the right time because they were just training every single one of their soldiers at once which is really weird and they weren't ready to use them to attack so they are all armatures and we can easily beat them. On the other hand we have all their trained soldiers and wacky machines to deal with! </p>

            <p>They are for some reason kinda advanced in building but they aren't as advanced in tactics. They also are fried chicken so they are a little stupid and will be memorized and bow down to a certain thing called “The all most wonderful bright circle beam” which they are all mesmerized at. So if we can get that and bring it out so all they fried chicken can see it we will get all of them distracted and mesmerized and then attack when they are weak and beat them and take the world back! </p>

            <p>So after the stupid chicken in the front line is over we go to everything in the middle in the big battle field where we can defeat the fried chicken army. But before we can win we have to get into the castle which is heavily guarded with fried chicken everywhere. The hard thing is having enough soldiers, weapons, and ammo to defeat all the castle guards and weapons.</p>

            <p>So we go in. </p>
