            Chapter 1
        </div>
            <p>First imagine this book based off of 7000 years ago.Then imagine your on a boat traveling with your Viking mom, dad, brother, sister and friends now you can start.</p>
            <p>“Row your ors row row row” raise the sails raise them high, ”My leader says in a loud voice. </p>
            <p>Hi my name is Violet. I'm only 9 years old and I'm too young to raise the sails or row a boat …so I have to clean the kitchen. It always smells like old berries and uncooked fish and I absolutely do not like to clean the kitchen floor. I always get splinters from it. Also have to make fork and spoons out of old sticks.	</p>
            <p>Traveling and being a Viking is hard very hard </p>
            <p>Finally I shout here my dad shouts”when we get on land I'll make a longhouse and Loki, Violet and Nick go gather berries for dinner and also gather sheep. Mom and grandpa and grandma will go gather meat”. Somewhere around 10:15 or so the long house was built, so everyone got into their bed, made out of wood and sheep fur.</p>
            <p>In the morning, I made bacon and I also made a fruit salad for everyone. Then when everyone woke up, we ate and we got to build more materials like we made more longhouses. And we also made a house to make weapons and we told the other Vikings about this land.</p>
            <p>By  the afternoon more  Vikings and friends had come and even before 10 our whole village was done. We went to bed again.</p>
