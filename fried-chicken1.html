            <p> Once there was a man named Ben and he liked Fried chicken. One day he was at home and he just got a new fryer and he decided to make fried chicken! He got his favorite chicken and put it into his breading mix with flour, milk, and bread crumbs. Little did he know he was using evil food milk (this was illegal in America because 50 years ago in 1969 a group of people made the milk and used it to make food into evil monsters luckily nobody got eaten but people got really hurt and some people got almost eaten and some people got little chunks of them bitten off and some people almost died but nobody died). He didn't know that the milk label covered up the label that said evil milk on it. It was the only one left in the world and the bad guys who made it were the only ones who knew how to make it and they managed to get one of them into the store. So Ben was making the fried chicken and  when he was  looking away the chicken was cooking but then the chicken came out and was about 6'11‚Äù and had arms and legs and came out and Ben was running for his life and was running to his bedroom and was trying to take the screen off his window and he got it of in time. But the the chicken came in and broke the door down and Ben jumped right out of the window and the chicken did to and jumped right on top of Ben, but Ben had a pocket knife and cut the chicken right open and then ran because the chicken was really hurt and he ran next door but the fried chicken grew back his body part and ran next door and the chicken couldn't unlock the THREE DOORS that the neighbors have and they are all metal so the chicken couldn't get through so they closed all the window and locked them and stayed in their house.</p>
