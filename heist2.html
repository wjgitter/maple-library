            <p>They planned this for seven o'clock at night December 5th. They made sure to get good nights of sleep because in two days they were going to pull off the heist. Two days later, it was time for the heist in only an hour, and they were getting ready. They drove to the bank in an old rusty car. They put on their disguises and used the ladder to get up onto the roof.</p>
            <p>They only had an ephemeral amount of time because the bank closed fairly soon. Once they were on the roof they went through the escape exit on the roof and silently went down to the lobby. Once they were in the lobby, Alfred knew it was his time to shine, so he ran for the vault. Amir pointed him out and ran for him. Alfred quickly got tackled by the security guards and Amir. Tyrone pickpocketed one of the security guards without being noticed. </p>
            <p>Tyron broke through the vault unconspicuously. He used the keycard to get into the vault and quickly grabbed some wads of cash. On the way out he was clumsy and tripped the alarm which had caught the attention of security.they had all been caught and were headed for prison. Their sentence was 20 years each in prison for multiple charges such as identity theft and attempted robbery.</p>
            <p>While they were in jail they were all very upset especially with Tyrone for being clumsy even though they were all at fault. They did not want to be there so they started coming up with ideas to escape. Then Amir said “Instead of escaping and possibly getting an even larger sentence, we should just be cordial  so they can get a shorter sentence.” Everyone thought that was a good idea but Tyrone just wanted to escape so he thought of ways to escape. The police already didn't pay much attention to them because of their politeness, and out of nowhere Tyrone started to escape through the vents.</p>
