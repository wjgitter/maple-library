            Alaska
        </div>
            <p>Alaska is the biggest state but they don't have many people there. The people in Alaska could hide or could let other states use the land for military protection. Alaska is also near the oceans so they could team up with Hawaii if they can get boats out there quick enough. Alaska's advantages are not much but they are rich in natural resources and fish is a good source of protein for people to eat. Again, hiding or making treaties with other states would be Alaska's best bet for winning the war of the states. States who don't have enough money or resources could also seek Alaska's help.</p>
            <p>Alaska's military. What to say, what to say, oh, I got something! It sucks. There is no military, and if it was there would be like only two people fighting in it. That's not very good for a war, you need many, many people in an army and not just a few. Alaska has a very cold climate which makes it hard to survive in. That's probably why there aren't many people who live there. Alaska overall is probably one of the worst states to be stuck in for this war. </p>

            <p>“Um, hi. Would you like to ally with me for some of my resources?” Alaska says.</p>
            <p>“Uhhhhhhh, why?” Wisconsin replies.</p>
            <p>“Because you never know when you need some good resources!” Alaska begged. </p>
            <p>“Um, you know that I'm Wisconsin, right? I have lots of resources that I am savoring for when we truly need them, when the other states are starving and looking for food! Well give them cheese so good, they'll transfer to team Wisconsin! Go pack go!” Wisconsin cheers.</p>
            <p>“Why did I come to you?” Alaska moans.</p>
            <p>“No idea, don't ask me. But could I interest you in some fine aged feta cheese? It's lactose intolerant if you were wondering, but it's still so good it takes you to dairyland!”</p>
            <p>“Naurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr and no one cares about the cheese facts!” *Alaska walks away* I love how states can WALK.</p>
