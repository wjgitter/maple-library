        <div  style="text-align: center"><p>Today I will teach you how to make a savory microwave hot dog.</p>
        </div>
            <p>Take out the cold, frozen, savory, gourmet, $7, pack of Costco microwave hot dogs from the freezing refrigerator, and set them carefully on top of the counter and wait for the cold, frozen, savory, gourmet, $7, pack of Costco microwave hot dogs to thaw out.</p>
            <p>Once the cold, frozen, savory, gourmet, $7, pack of Costco microwave hot dogs are done thawing (you could tell when the cold, frozen, savory, gourmet, $7, pack of Costco microwave hot dogs are done thawing because the cold, frozen, savory, gourmet, $7, pack of Costco microwave hot dogs will not be frozen solid anymore) and are now “the slightly cold, savory, gourmet, $7, pack of Costco microwave hot dogs” and cut open the slightly cold, savory, gourmet, $7, pack of Costco microwave hot dogs, and take one slightly cold, savory, gourmet, Costco microwave hot dog out of the slightly cold, savory, gourmet, $7, pack of Costco microwave hot dogs.</p>
            <p>Wrap the slightly cold, savory, gourmet, Costco microwave hot dog in a paper towel, and put it in the microwave for 30 seconds. As the slightly cold, savory, gourmet, Costco microwave hot dog is heating in the microwave, get a plate and a large hot dog bun and put the large hot dog bun on the plate. While the  slightly cold, savory, gourmet, Costco microwave hot dog is finishing getting warmed up, you can watch it go around and around in the microwave. Once the slightly cold, savory, gourmet, Costco microwave hot dog is done the microwave should let out a ding.</p>
            <p>Take the slightly cold, savory, gourmet, Costco microwave hot dog out of the microwave, and now that the slightly cold, savory, gourmet, Costco microwave hot dog isn't cold anymore it is now “the warm, savory, gourmet, Costco microwave hot dog”, and then take the warm, savory, gourmet, Costco microwave hot dog out of the microwave and out of the paper towel that holds the warm, savory, gourmet, Costco microwave hot dog.</p>
            <p>Put the warm, savory, gourmet, Costco microwave hot dog on the large hot dog bun.</p>
            <p>Put ketchup, mustard, relish, and onions on to the warm, savory, gourmet, Costco microwave hot dog (in a large hot dog bun).</p>
            <p>Bite into that delicious warm, savory, gourmet, Costco microwave hot dog (in a large hot dog bun with ketchup, mustard, relish, and onions), and taste that pure microwaved goodness.</p>
