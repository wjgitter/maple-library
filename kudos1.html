            Kudos
        </div>
        <div class="subtitle">
            By Miles and Will
        </div>
            <p>Once upon a Botswana day, the juvenile siblings, Samantha, Gabe, Felipe, and Randy, were turning 13 and 35/56. The village that they were born into has a policy about coming of age. To become a man, you need to find, ride, and bring back a fockle of kudus to the village. The siblings were unanimous about the decision to set off on their grand journey and were looking forward to it.</p>
            <p>As they set off into the barren desert on the quest to find a fockle of kudos to prove themselves as adults. The indispensable leader, Felipe, decided that they should journey together to the northern mountains off in the distance through the desert. As they started off on the tiring walk, Samantha started getting very angry and hungry because she had not eaten breakfast. She started to vilify Philippe to Gabe about how bad of an idea it is to go across the whole desert because they used all their water in the first 30 minutes, and they were going to die of dehydration.</p>   
            <p>As they broke camp and started to ascend the mountains, Randy was being cynical about Felipe's decision to climb the hill. A rock came tumbling down from Phillipe's foot, causing him to trip and fall into a pack of stitunga. After that terrible and tragic death of Randy, the disheartened travelers continued the quest in the name of their lost brother. As they finished their ascension to the summit of the hill, they gazed down, and they saw it!</p>
            <p>"A massive flock of kudos," Gabe yells, "Oh my, they're massive!” as they were jumping for joy with Felipe and Samantha!</p>
            <p>They run and jump down the hill to meet the flock of kudos, who did not notice the conspicuous teenagers. </p>
            <p>As they near the bottom of the hill, Felipe says, "Get behind the bush so they don't notice us.” </p>
            <p>As they settle down in the bush, whispering quietly about how to catch three kudos. After they pondered, they came to the conclusion that they should just tackle them, but to achieve that kudos to enter their vicinity, strike, tackling the massive 0.000128 nautical miles tall kudos. As the darkness rises, the flock of kudos meanders their way over to them. The teens waited till they could see the lights of their eyes to jump and tackle the unsuspecting kudos. They strike with fierce ambition. Yelling war cries to the lone Fockle of kudos.</p>
                
            <p>Once they have the kudos, the elated Philippe shouts , "We did it! We did it! We did it.”</p> 
            <p>Another voice cried, coming out from Samantha, saying, "We need to run back before we run out of supplies.”</p>
        
            <p>They're rushing home in the dead of night when they see the lights of the village. A beacon of hope for the weary travelers. The commute home is an ephemeral one, but very tiring. They hoped to make it out before the ravishing sun made the trip home an unbearable journey; as the sun rose, the heat soon followed. It was a battle of wills.</p>
            <p>"It's so hot!,"yelled a dehydrated Samantha. </p>
            <p>"It's only going to get worse," responded Philippe. </p>
            <p>"The village is only 0.856 nautical miles away now," said Gabe. </p>
            <p>They picked up their pace, and within 5 mins, at a bristling pace, they were only 0.148 nautical miles away from the village. The cordial villagers saw the kudus and rejoiced that their children were home. The villagers prepared a meal and a drink for the siblings. As they dismounted the kudus, they were whisked away to the banquet that was prepared for the exhausted travelers. As they were seated, they saw the 0.000987 nautical miles long smoked cow prepared for them. Gabe spoke softly to Samantha, "I was so hungry the entire trip.”</p>
        
            <p>After a long day of celebration, they were overjoyed to be home and safe. </p>
