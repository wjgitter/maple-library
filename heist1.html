            <p>Four days earlier… Three roommates were in a worn down apartment in downtown Austin, Texas. Their names were Alfred, Amir, and Tyrone.</p>
            <p>Alfred was a former juvenile delinquent for stealing from the cash register at the local grocery store. Amir was the core of the group because he pays most of the rent and has great technology skills. Tyrone was not the smartest out of the three but was still indispensable because he helped with food payments. Alfred brought in the mail one day and saw three letters from the Austin Texas bank telling them that all three of them had negative account balances. Alfred was in shock because he knew they had cut back on expenses. Alfred told Amir and Tyrone that they had a big problem, they were in debt. </p>
            <p>They had no clue what to do so they started brainstorming ideas to ascend out of debt. Their first thought was to work overtime at their jobs at the local Bass Pro-Shop. Amir realized that working overtime would take too much time that they don't have. Then out of nowhere Tyrone said, “Let's rob the largest bank in Texas; the Austin Texas Bank.” At first everyone was in disagreement, then Alfred realized they had everything they needed. Alfred said, “I have experience robbing stores, Tyrone can go unnoticed fairly well and is fast, and Amir is great with technology so he can find out what the layout of the bank is and can hack the cameras.”</p>
            <p>They came to a unanimous decision to rob this bank. They had to come up with a great plan because the bank had great security, and without an incredible plan this bank heist would not work. After they were thinking very hard for about a day, they had finalized their plan for pulling off the heist. Their plan was to sneak up onto the roof with a ladder. Amir found out that like most buildings in the area the bank also has a safety fire exit on its roof. Once on the roof they would put on their disguises of security guards and sneak in through the escape exit to get down into the bank.</p>
            <p>Alfred, who would not be in a disguise, would run for the bank vault as bait so he could get tackled by security and Amir. While all the attention would be on Alfred, Tyrone takes a keycard from one of the real security guards and goes for the vault. Now he would be in the vault and is freely stealing wads of cash to his demand. Then he escapes through the vault door again while Tyrone escapes through the back door with the keycard Amir pretends to arrest Alfred and puts him in a cop car that Tyrone was already in and then would drive away.</p>
