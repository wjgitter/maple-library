            Chapter 1
        </div>
            <p>It was a seemingly normal day for Pierre, a juvenile kid who lived in France, and was curious about the world. All he wanted to do that Saturday was to see his friend George. George was Pierre's only friend, as Pierre liked to keep to himself.</p> 
            <p>Pierre went to his father and asked, “Father, I would greatly appreciate it if I could attend the house of my friend George.”</p>
            <p>Pierre's father was a cynic and thought that Pierre had ill intentions. Pierre's father simply said, “No, ”and walked away. Pierre wouldn't take no for an answer, but little did he know his father had much more in store for him. As soon as his father was out of sight, Pierre made a mad dash to the door. But something was wrong, the door was locked. In fact all of the doors and windows in the whole house were locked. Pierre's father had outsmarted him and knew Pierre would try to escape. It was almost indispensable that Pierre had to reason with his father, but he was nowhere to be found.</p>
            <p>“Shoot!” Pierre exclaimed, as he knew there was no other way out of the house. Pierre examined all of the doors and windows in the house just to be safe. Then, Pierre reached the staircase to the attic, which he went to ascend  and he found what he was looking for.</p>
            <p>The final window in the entire house was unlocked.</p>
            <p>“Father must have forgot to go up here,” Pierre thought to himself. Pierre felt great elation at this sight and immediately climbed out of the window, onto the roof. Once on the roof, Pierre a rush as if he was on top of the world. He had never been this free before. It was no time to get emotional though, as he wanted to see George immediately. Pierre, almost slipping off the roof, had an ephemeral moment of doubt. This was Pierre's first time leaving the house without adult supervision. Pierre then maneuvered his way down the roof, and onto the sidewalk. After he took a few steps, he heard a noise behind him, almost like a shuffle. Then, before he knew it, a gag was placed in Pierre's mouth. A bag was placed over his head and he was stuffed into a white van by a seemingly mysterious figure</p>
