            <p>Tyrone was halfway through the vent when Alfred and Amir had noticed. Alfred and Amir were confused why he was escaping because they already had a good plan, but it was working so they just followed. Somehow Tyrone's plan worked and they all escaped and had a great feeling of elation. There was a flaw though, now they had no home,  possessions, or anything. Everyone vilified Tyrone for being cynic. </p>
            <p>Tyrone had now come up with another master plan. They were going to break into the local Radio Shack so they could use a computer to become online scammers. They would create a bank account at the Dallas bank so they could manage their money. That night they broke into the Radio Shack and used their computer. They started to write contracts in emails tricking them into getting money. Within a week they had collectively received 40,000 dollars.</p>
            <p>They eventually moved into their own homes but still kept in touch with each other, and still did online scams for living.</p>
